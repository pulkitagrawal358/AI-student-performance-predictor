It analyzes student data and shows how different factors affect academic scores.

Tools Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

Dataset

Student Performance Dataset (CSV) from Kaggle.

What I Did

* Cleaned and analyzed the dataset
* Visualized student performance data
* Built a simple Linear Regression model
* Predicted student scores
* Evaluated the model results

Result

The model helps in understanding student performance and predicting scores based on study-related factors.
